This task was well-structured and easy to follow.

I used useEffect to fetch API data and implemented basic pagination by updating the page state when the 'Load More' button is clicked, triggering a new fetch request.

For styling, I used Tailwind to improve efficiency and maintainability. I also added some tests with Vitest, though there’s room for improvement.

While I didn’t complete the mobile responsive design, I focused on the key parts to ensure functionality and implemented design details.

Overall, it was a great exercise with nice UI work!
